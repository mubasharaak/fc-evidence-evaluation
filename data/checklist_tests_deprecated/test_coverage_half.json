On Sunday, Twitter removed a post retweeted by Trump that claimed the CDC had \u201cquietly\u201d updated its guidance to indicate only 6% of the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll \u2014 roughly 9,000 deaths \u2014  was actually caused by the virus, according to a CNN report. The tweet said the remaining 94% had \u201cother serious illnesses.\u201d Fauci told the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC guidance, last updated on Aug. 26, indicates that of the people who have died from the virus, \u201ca certain percentage of them had nothing else but just Covid.\u201d However, people with underlying illnesses also die from Covid-19, he said. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn\u2019t die of Covid-19. They did,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the program. \u201cSo the numbers you\u2019ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that. It\u2019s not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it\u2019s 180-plus-thousand deaths",

Vaccines traditionally contain either weakened viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus.\n\nBut an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material \u2013 mRNA \u2013 that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body.\n\nThis approach mimics what the SARS-CoV-2 does in nature \u2013 but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causing disease. This preview gives the immune system time to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected.\n\nWhile this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot be transmitted to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few more days.",

The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) supports the reforms implemented\nin this bill and highlights the need for such reforms to close loopholes that threaten the democratic\nprocess.\nThe Election Integrity Act of 2021 is a commonsense approach that makes it easy to vote and\nhard to cheat. It provides fair and consistent rules for Georgia elections statewide, a duty of the\nGeorgia legislature.

The landing system on Mars 2020 mission includes a parachute, descent vehicle, and an approach called a \"skycrane maneuver\" for lowering the rover on a tether to the surface during the final seconds before landing.\n\nThis type of landing system provides the ability to land a very large, heavy rover on the surface of Mars in a more precise landing area than was possible before Curiosity's landing. Mars 2020 takes things one step further. It adds new entry, descent, and landing (EDL) technologies, such as Terrain-Relative Navigation (TRN). This sophisticated navigation system allows the rover to detect and avoid hazardous terrain by diverting around it during its descent through the Martian atmosphere. A microphone allows engineers to analyze entry, descent, and landing. It might also capture sounds of the rover at work, which would provide engineers with clues about the rover's health and operations, and would be a treat to hear.",

Moreover, we demonstrated that milk contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and that their concentrations are correlated with milk\u2019s ability to effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We found evidence of SARS-CoV-2 on the areola/nipple region of several women, but it is unclear whether this RNA reflects viable virus. As such, our data do not suggest that infected women should systematically wash their breasts prior to breastfeeding or expressing milk. However, and in support of recommendations put forth by the WHO, if a mother who is confirmed/suspected to have COVID-19 has just coughed over her exposed breast, she should gently wash the breast with soap and warm water before feeding (37). Taken together with the well-documented benefits of breastfeeding to maternal and infant health, our data support recommendations to encourage breastfeeding in women with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness.",

That helped them raise their incomes, expand their farms, improve their housing and advance their education. But about a quarter of a million Black farmers \"stand as a glaring exception to this picture of progress.\"\n\nAmong the issues raised in the report: Black farmers got smaller loans and far less guidance than white farmers in the same economic class. White borrowers got most of their loans for capital investments, such as farm improvements or enlargement, while Black farmers\u2019 loans were primarily for living expenses and annual operating costs."

Kelly asked the court to prohibit the certification of results that included mail-in ballots or direct the Pennsylvania General Assembly to choose electors. \n\nOne week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and after millions of residents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots \"were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent,\" the court wrote. The court\u2019s three page order did not address whether Act 77 and the state constitution were in conflict.\n\n\"Clearly the state legislature and governor believe it is consistent with the state constitution,\" Toomey said. \"This law wasn\u2019t challenged when it was passed, it wasn\u2019t challenged when it was applied during the June primary election.

SARS-CoV infected civet cats\nand infected humans in 2002 and MERS-CoV is found in dromedary camels and infected humans in 2012.

The demand letters identify dozens of factually inaccurate statements made by each of the organizations as part of a \u201cdisinformation campaign\u201d to injure Smartmatic and discredit the 2020 U.S. election.    \n\nAccording to Smartmatic\u2019s demand letters, these organizations could have easily discovered the falsity of the statements and implications made about Smartmatic by investigating their statements before publishing them to millions of viewers and readers. Smartmatic had nothing to do with the \u201ccontroversies\u201d that certain public and private figures have alleged regarding the 2020 U.S. election.  Multiple fact-checkers have consistently debunked these false statements with stunning consistency and regularity. \n\n\u201cThey have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic because there is no evidence.  This campaign was designed to defame Smartmatic and undermine legitimately conducted elections,\u201d said Antonio Mugica, CEO of Smartmatic. \u201cOur efforts are more than just about Smartmatic or any other company.  This campaign is an attack on election systems and election workers in an effort to depress confidence in future elections and potentially counter the will of the voters, not just here, but in democracies around the world.\u201d\n\nSince its founding in 2000, Smartmatic has designed and implemented secure election technologies in twenty-five countries and helped election management bodies record over five billion votes without a single security breach, and where every single vote is auditable.\n\nSmartmatic\u2019s only involvement in the United States in the 2020 election was as the manufacturing partner, system integrator, and software developer for Los Angeles County\u2019s publicly owned voting system.  Election processes conducted using Smartmatic technology have been praised by The Carter Cente",

                        "answer": "At any given moment about 2,000 thunderstorms roll over Earth, producing some 50 flashes of lightning every second. Each lightning burst creates electromagnetic waves that begin to circle around Earth captured between Earth's surface and a boundary about 60 miles up. Some of the waves - if they have just the right wavelength - combine, increasing in strength, to create a repeating atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann resonance. This resonance provides a useful tool to analyze Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine what types of atoms and molecules exist in Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe waves created by lightning do not look like the up and down waves of the ocean, but they still oscillate with regions of greater energy and lesser energy. These waves remain trapped inside an atmospheric ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a part of the atmosphere filled with charged particles, which begins about 60 miles up into the sky. In this case, the sweet spot for resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as long, etc) as the circumference of Earth. This is an extremely low frequency wave that can be as low as 8 Hertz (Hz) - some one hundred thousand times lower than the lowest frequency radio waves used to send signals to your AM/FM radio. As this wave flows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfect spot such that the crests and troughs are aligned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each other to pump up the original signal.\n\nWhile they'd been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the early 1960s. Since then, scientists have discovered that variations in the resonances correspond to changes in the seasons, solar activity, activity in Earth's magnetic environment, in water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.",

HIV causes a chronic infection and integrates itself into people\u2019s genomes; there\u2019s no natural immune response that eliminates the virus that a vaccine can mimic.

That coating protects the mRNA from enzymes in the body that would otherwise break it down.

Since only part of the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the person vaccinated but it is antigenic.\n\nAfter the piece of the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA strand and disposes of them using enzymes in the cell. It is important to note that the mRNA strand never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus or affects genetic material. This information helps counter misinformation about how mRNA vaccines alter or modify someone\u2019s genetic makeup.\n\nOnce displayed on the cell surface, the protein or antigen causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating T-cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.",

                        "answer": "Dirac is responsible for several of the great breakthroughs in 20th century physics. At the age of 23, while still a graduate student, he took Heisenberg\u2019s ideas and found the fundamental insight into what it means to \u201cquantize\u201d a classical mechanical system: functions on phase space become operators, with the Poisson bracket becoming the commutator. This remains at the basis of our understanding of quantum mechanics, and Dirac\u2019s textbook on the subject remains a rigorously clear explanation of the fundamental ideas of quantum theory. Two years later he found the correct relativistic generalization of the Schrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, which to this day is at the basis of our modern understanding of particle physics. This equation also turns out to play a fundamental role in mathematics, linking analysis, geometry and topology through the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Around the same time, Dirac was one of the people responsible for developing quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics, as well as coming up with an understanding of the role of magnetic monopoles in electromagnetism. he period of Dirac\u2019s most impressive work was relatively short, ending around 1933. By 1937, the year he married, Farmelo reports Bohr\u2019s reaction to reading Dirac\u2019s latest paper (on the \u201clarge numbers hypothesis\u201d)",

Under Wisconsin law, voters do not need a reason or excuse, such as being out of town on Election Day, to vote absentee.  Any voter who prefers to vote by absentee ballot may request one.  You have several options for requesting an absentee ballot and casting your vote. \nRequest an Absentee Ballot by Mail\n\nIf you are a registered Wisconsin voter, you can download the Application For Absentee Ballot (EL-121).  Just complete the form and mail it to your municipal clerk's office. You can find your clerk at MyVote WI: myvote.wi.gov by searching for your voter record or performing an address search. You can also find your clerk by searching through the list of all Wisconsin municipal clerks.  Your application must be received by the clerk no later than 5:00 p.m. on the Thursday before the election in order for an absentee ballot to be SENT to you.  You will also need to provide a copy of your acceptable photo ID with your request.  If you have not previously provided a copy of photo ID, photo ID must accompany your first application by mail.  More information about photo ID can be found at www.bringit.wi.gov. \n\nIf you are not already registered, you will need to register to vote before an absentee ballot can be sent to you.\n\nVoters who are indefinitely confined due to age, illness, infirmity, or disability may request that a ballot be automatically sent to them for each election.  Indefinitely confined voters do not need to provide a photo ID with their absentee ballot request.  If you or someone you know are indefinitely confined you will make this designation in box 6 of the Application for Absentee Ballot (EL-121).

                        "answer": "The immune system is a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to help fight off infection from harmful bacteria or viruses. When a disease-causing agent, such as virus or bacteria, invades your body, your immune system recognises it as harmful and will trigger a response to destroy it.\n\nOne of the ways your immune system fights off infection is by creating large proteins known as antibodies. These antibodies act as scouts, hunting down the infectious agent, and marking it for destruction by the immune system. Each antibody is specific to the bacteria or virus that it has detected and will trigger a specific immune response. These specific antibodies will remain in the immune system after the infection has gone. This means that if the same disease is encountered again, your immune system has a \u2018memory\u2019 of the disease and is ready to quickly destroy it before you get sick and any symptoms can develop.\n\nSometimes, however, the immune system doesn\u2019t always win this initial battle against the harmful bacteria or virus and you can become very ill or \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 die. Vaccination is the safest and most common way to gain immunity against a bacteria or virus that your body has yet to encounter. Vaccines contain a harmless form of the bacteria or virus that causes the disease you are being immunised against. The bacteria or virus will be killed, greatly weakened, or broken down into small parts before use in the vaccine so that they can trigger an immune response without making you sick. Your immune system will still attack the harmless form of bacteria or virus from the vaccine and will produce antibodies to fight it off. The immune system then keeps a memory of the disease, so if a vaccinated person encounters the disease years later, their immune system is ready to fight it off and prevent an infection from developing.",

                        "answer": "Get vaccinated\n\nVaccines are the best defence against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections such as flu. They provide good protection against hospitalisation and death. They also reduce the risk of long-term symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Getting fully vaccinated is the best way of protecting you and others against COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\n\nIf you have not yet received all the COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you, you should get vaccinated as soon as possible. It usually takes around two to three weeks for your body to develop its protective response. Meet outdoors or keep indoor spaces well ventilated\n\nMeeting outdoors vastly reduces the risk of airborne transmission, but this may not always be possible.\n\nIf you\u2019re indoors, you should let fresh air in to reduce the risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe more fresh air you let into your home or other enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles.\n\nYou can let in fresh air by uncovering vents and opening doors and windows. Opening your windows for just 10 minutes, or a small amount of time continuously where you can, makes a significant difference. This is particularly important before, during and after meeting people you do not live with indoors.\n\nIf you are concerned about the costs of heating, opening windows for shorter periods of time can still help to reduce the risk of the virus spreading. Wear a face covering\n\nWearing a face covering or face mask can reduce the number of particles containing viruses that are released from the mouth and nose of someone (from coughs, sneezes and speaking) who is infected with COVID-19 and other respiratory infections.\n\nAlthough wearing a face covering is no longer a legal requirement, they are still strongly recommended in indoor areas where you come into contact with people you do not usually meet.  \n\nIf you have symptoms or have a positive COVID-19 test result and you need to leave your home",

                        "answer": "Twenty-eight states have statewide orders requiring face coverings in public. Masks are recommended by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization to prevent spreading Covid-19.\n\nThe governors of states including Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado and Montana all announced statewide mandates last week. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in announcing the mandate that there was evidence showing a mandate prompted more people to wear a face covering, despite being hard to enforce.\n\n\u201cThis is a responsible, bipartisan, common sense step to take,\u201d Polis said during a news conference at the Boettcher Mansion in Jefferson County, Colorado, on Thursday. \u201cWe have a choice in Colorado: either more mask wearing and more attention to social distancing or more damage to our economy and loss of life.\u201d\n\nThough mandates across states have similar requirements, they vary on exemptions. In Texas, the requirement is waived for religious services, working out or voting. Kids under the age of 10 and people with a medical condition that prevents wearing a face covering are also exempt from the order.\n\nStatewide mandates usually take the place of any local ordinances or business-specific requirements for face coverings. Masks are also required at a growing number of stores, including Walmart and Kroger.\n\nIn addition to statewide mandates, some states and cities have placed certain areas under mask orders. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, while not announcing a statewide mandate, has put specific counties under a mandate. Other places, such as Oklahoma City, have imposed mandates on themselves without statewide requirements.\n\nIn Georgia, where there is no statewide mandate, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a mask order for the city. Bottoms\u2019 action prompted Gov. Brian Kemp to file a lawsuit against her and members of the Atlanta city council over the requirement.",

                        "answer": "Lorraine Minnite, a political science professor at Rutgers University and author of \"The Myth of Voter Fraud,\" told USA TODAY that dead people being able to vote is a myth. \n\n\"There could be a short period of time in which if you took a snapshot of a (voter registration) list there might be some names of people on there who have died yesterday or died last week,\" Minnite said. \"It takes election officials a little bit of time to sort those things out.\" \n\nShe said people who claim that dead people can vote are referencing voting registration lists, which is misleading because election officials regularly clean up such lists. Some states do it more vigorously and frequently. \n\nMinnite added that, on occasion, there will be cases where an elderly couple will vote by mail ahead of the election, and a week before an election they die without the election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening to the integrity of an election.\"\n\nThat was echoed by Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in elections, who told USA TODAY that voter files are updated by county officials regularly. But he said that in any given year, it is possible for a fraction of people to either move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-address information and other data to identify those people and update files.\n\nHe said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting that many county election officials have discarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, and then a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",

You see your net salary at the end of the month reflecting on your hard earned money with overtimes, bank shifts and those weekend night outs and getaways you've missed because you're at work. But have you ever really taken a closer look on your payslip or do you just look on the bottom right hand corner of it to see how much you've been paid? Well, understanding how you are getting paid can guide you about when are the best days to book shifts, how taxes impact your earnings which may help with planning your finances accordingly. \n\n        NHS salary follows Agenda for Change which is the main pay system for NHS staff excluding doctors, senior managers and dentists. As an overseas nurse, you will start as a Pre-registered nurse on a Band 4 pay scale. Once you've passed the OSCE and NMC has granted your PIN, you can start to work and be paid as a Band 5. Being a newly qualified nurse, you will start on the lowest point of Band 5 pay scale. Salary for a point 1 Band 5 normally starts at \u00a325,655 per year and will increase annually provided you have completed your annual appraisal. \n\n     Looking at all the numbers in your payslip might be intimidating. But by deeply understanding what those numbers mean, you can spot if there are errors, if you\u2019ve been paid correctly and make better decisions about when to do extra work.  \n\nFor those who are exploring to work in the UK, this will also help you understand how much registered nurses are being paid and its coverage.",

Included in the demands were revoking the king\u2019s legal immunity, increasing public scrutiny of the king\u2019s assets and curbing the palace\u2019s involvement in politics by preventing him from expressing political opinions and endorsing coups.\n\nWhile such demands might seem almost mundane in other democratic societies, in Thailand they are groundbreaking \u2013 the country has strict l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 laws and public criticism of the royal family is a political and cultural taboo.",
