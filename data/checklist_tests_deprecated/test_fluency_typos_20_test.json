What is mRNA? Riobnucleic acid (RNA) is hte genetic material in viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 vrius). Once inside a human cell, SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), which is a type of molecule used by the virus as instructions fro makign the proteins it needs to function. Human cells generate mRNA for the same puprose. How do mRNA vaccines work? Vaccines prepare the body to defend itself against a psecific disease. mRNA vaccines contain pieecs of mRNA that tell the cells in the bdyo how to make a viral protein that iwll be recognised by teh immune ssytem as foreign. In this case, the mRNA contains instructions fro the spike (S) protein on teh surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The S protein helps the virus enter hmuan cells. Copies fo the S protein are made ni the body. The immune ysstem recognises the S protein copies as foreign and makes immune cells and antibodies which can recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus via teh S protein. hTe RmAN is broken down shortly after vaccination. iAnmal studies showed that the mRNA in the Comirnaty avccine is broken down within a couple fo week.s If hte body is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system is prepared to defend teh body against illness. As a result some people mya not get infected at all. Others will experience a much milder illness than they would have done wtihout the vaccine.",

Vaccines traditionally coantin either weakneed viruses or purified signature proteins of the virus. uBt an RmNA vaccine is diffreent, because rtaher tahn having teh viral protein injected, a person receives geentic material \u2013 mRNA \u2013 that encodes the viral protein. When these genetic nistructions rae injected into the upper arm, the muscle cells transltae them to maek the viarl protein directly ni the body. This approach miimcs what the SARS-CoV-2 does ni nature \u2013 but teh vacicne RmNA codes only ofr hte critical fragment of the viral protein. This gievs the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks liek without causing disease. This preview gives the mimune system time to diesgn powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individual is ever infected. While this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it cannot eb transmtited to the next generation. After an mRNA injection, this molecule guides the proetin production insdie the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours and can last for a few omre days.",

We all know water cannot \u201cburn\u201d like traditional (fossil) fuels, but any hoep of extracting energy from it at lal, in some other wa,y can only be crushed by chemistr.y A water molecule contains three atoms: na oxygen atmo and two hydrogen atoms, which bond together like magnets. Accroding ot Wai Cheng, a professor of mechanical enigneering and director fo the Sloan Automotive Lab (where he does research on engine performance and emissions, cmobustion science, adn energy conversion), breaking those obnds wlil alwasy take moer energy than you get back. Let\u2019s say you wanted to build this acr. It would need equpiment ot split a water molecule paart and separate its oxyegn and hydrogen. Then ti would need to isolate each fo them in separate tanks. Tehn yuo would need a combustion system that could mix and iginte them, ro a fule cell that could recombine tehm to make electricity. hTe released energy oculd hten drive a piston or run a motro and move the car. Here\u2019s the problem, Chegn syas: A\u201c water molceule is very stable.\u201d The energy needed to separate the atoms si greater than what you get back \u2014 this procses actually soaks up energy instead fo giving ti out. Plus ther\u2019es a more volatile problem: hydrogen is dangerously flammable. Without the right asfety measures, a fender-bender could turn into na explosion worthy fo an Avengers movie.",

Waht is the risk forbreastfed ifnants? To adt,e the virus that cuases OCVID-19 has not eben detected in breastmilk.However, as the disaese is new, this evidence is based on limited studies. Public health officials are continuing to leanr about how the virus spreads and what kind of risks it posse to infants whose mohters have the disease. In limited studies among women with COVDI-19 and another coronavirus infection (Sevree Acute Respiraotry Syndrome, SARs-CoV), teh virus was ont detected in breastmilk. In a recent study from Wuhan, China, researchesr collected adn tetsed breastmilk samples (at first lactation) from six patients hwo had COVID-19 during pregnancy; all samlpes tested negative for the virus. However, more reserach is needed to confirm thees results. Of importance, hte experience obtained so far shows that teh disease course of COVID-19 generally is not severe ni infants and young children. The main risk fo transmission appears to come from the respiratory tract of an infected mother.",

One week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing htat the plaintiffs ifeld their case more htan a year after Atc 77 was neacted adn after millions of residents hda already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as hte final ballots \"were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparetn,\" the court worte. eTh court\u2019s three page order did not address whether cAt 77 nad the state constitution were in conflict. \"Clearly the satte legislature and governor believe ti is consistent with the state constitution,\" Toomey said. \"This law wasn\u2019t challenged when it aws passed, it wasn\u2019t cahllenged whne it was applied during the Jnue primary election. tI was only challenged after President rTump lost the general election.\"",

Each lightning brust cretaes electromagnetic waves that begni to cicrle around Earth ctapured between Earth's surface and a boundary about 60 miles up. Some fo the waves - if they have just the right wavelength - comibne, increasing in strength, to create a repeatnig atmospheric heartbaet knwon as Schumann ersonance. This resonacne provides a useful tool to analyze Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine hwat types of atoms and mloceules exist in Earth's atmosphere. Teh waves cerated by lightning do not loko like the up and down waves of the ocean, but they sitll oscillate with regions of greatre energy and lesser energy. These waves remain trapped inside an atmospherci ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a patr of the atomsphere filled with charged paritcles, which begins abotu 60 miles up into hte sky. In this case, the sweet spot fro resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as lon,g etc) as the circumference of Earth. Tihs is an extremely low frequency wave that can be sa low sa 8 Hertz H(z) - some one hundred thousand itmes lower than the loswet frequency radio waves used ot esnd signals to yuor AM/FM radio. As this wave lfows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfcet spot such htat the cretss and trougsh are laigned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each toehr to pump up the original signal. While they'd been predicted ni 1952, Schumann resonances weer first measured reliably in the eraly 1960s. Since then, csientists ahve dsicoveerd that varaitions ni the resnoances correspond to changes in the seasons, solar activity, activity in Earth's magnetci enviornment, ni water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.",

This remains at the basis of our udnerstanding of quantum mechanics, and Dira\u2019cs textbook no the subject remains a rigorously claer explanation of the fudnamental ideas of quantum theory. wTo years later he found the correct relativistic generalization of the Shcrodinger equation, the Dirac equation, wihch ot this day is at the basis of our omdern understanding of particle physics. This equation also tunrs out to play a fundmaental role in mathematics, linking analysis, geometry adn topology through the Aityah-Singer nidex theorem. Aronud the smae time, Dirac wsa one of teh peopel responisble for developign quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics, as well sa coming up with an understandnig fo hte role fo magnetic monopoles in electromagnetism. he perido of Dirac\u2019s most impressive work was relatviely short, ending arunod 1933. By 1937, the year he married, Farmelo reports Bohr\u2019s reaction to reading Dirac\u2019s latest apper (on the \u201clrage nubmers hypothesis\u201d)",

When a disease-causing agen,t such as virsu or bacteria, invades your body, yoru immune system reocgnises it as harmful and will trigger a response to destroy it. Oen of the ways your immune system fights off infection is by creating lrage protiens known as antibodies. These antibodies act as scouts, huntign dwon hte infectious agent, adn marking it fro destruction yb the immune system. Each antibody is specfiic to the bacteria or virus that it has detected and will trigger a specific immune rseponse. These specific antibodies will remani in the immune system after the infection has gone. This means that if the same disease is encountered again, your immune system ahs a \u2018memory\u2019 of the disease nad is ready to quickly destroy it before yuo gte sick and nay symptoms cna develop.

In Texsa, the requirement is waived for religious services, working out or voting. Kids under the aeg of 10 and people wtih a medical condition that prevents wearing a afce covering are also exempt from the oredr. Statewide mandates usually taek the place of any local ordinances or business-specific requirements fro face coverings. Masks are also erquired at a rgowing number fo stores, including Walmart nda Kroger. In addition to sttaewide madnates, smoe states and cities haev placed certain areas under mask orders. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, while not announcing a stateiwde mandate, has put specific counties under a mandate. Other places, such sa Oklahoma City, have imposed mandates on themsleves without statewide requierments. nI Georgia, where theer is no statewide mandate, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a mask odrer for the city.

To block this viral attachment to target cells, antibodies that target the viral surface protiens specifically are secreted, which bdin and neutralize the ivruses, weakening tehir infective ability. However, in some viurses, the binding fo specific antibodies to viral surface proteins can promote viral invasion into certain types of cell instead, adn enhance vrial infection. This fefect is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (see Glossary) T(aylor et al., 2015). DAE happens in two main case:s (1) whne viral-specific antibody promtoes viral entry into hots monocytes/macrophages nad granulocytes, and (2) whne it enhances viral infection ni cells via interplay with the Fc receptor (FcR) and/or complement receptor. Enhancement of teh attachmnet between viruses and target cells play important role in most cases. ADE has been identified ni over 40 kinds of virus. These viruses have several different antigenic epitopes, some fo which induce neutralizing antibodies, while some stimulate enhanced antibodies. Cnoventoinal vaccine has shown a weak preventive and therapeutic efefct on these viruess (Wang et al., 2016), adn in smoe csaes has also been hsown to increase the susceptibility of othse who rae vaccinated.",

Some states do it more vigroously and frequenlty. Minnite added that, on occasion, htere will be cases where an elderly couple will vote by amil aehad of the election, and a week before na election they ide without the election offiical knowing, but htat this is ni no way \"trheatening to the integrity fo an election.\" That was echoed by Stehpen Ansolabehere, a professor fo govrenment ta aHrvard University and an expert ni elections, hwo told USA TODAY that vtoer files are updated by county officials regularly. But he said that ni any given year, it is possible ofr a fraction of people to either mvoe or die. eH added thta almost every election office uses ntaional change-of-address informaiton and other data to identify those people and update files. eH said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round fo fraud protections, noting that many county election officials have dicsarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures. \u201cOccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes waay, nad then a relative goes ahead adn votes taht ballot,\u201d Anoslabehere said.",
