Some people mistakenly took that to mean the remaining 94% of coronaviurs-related daeths were caused by other underlyign helath conditions and not COVID-19. hTe imsconception wnet viral on social media; Twitter removed a tweet on Sunday that promoted the false interpretation of the CDC\u2019s data, which President Donald Trump shared to his 85.6 million followers, media outlets reported. What the CDC\u2019s update really means is ttha 94% of the people who died from the coronavirus had at least one other health conditoin, in addition ot COVID-19, that could have contributed to their passing \u2014 not taht the additional factor was the sole reason for it. In fact, the CDC mentinos taht \u201cfor deaths iwth conditions or causes ni addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d This aligns wtih what the agency has been saying all along. People over the age of 65 and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disaese and respiratory issues have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death from it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s laeding immunologist and a member of the White House Croonavirus Task Force told \u201dGodo Morning America\u201d on Tuesday taht the CDC\u2019s report \u201creally did reflect the reality\u201d of htose dying from COVI-D19. \u201cThe point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing esle but just COVID.

One of the vaccines s the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (also known as the \u2018Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine\u2019). What is mRNA? Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the genteic material ni viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 viru)s. Once inside a human clel, SARS-CoV-2 RNA acts as messenger ribonucleic acdi (mRNA), which is a type of molecule used yb the virus sa instructions for making the proteins it needs to function. Human cells generate mRNA for the same purpose. How do mRNA vaccines owrk? Vaccines prepare the body to defedn itself against a specific disease. mRNA vaccines contain pieces of mRNA that tell the cells in the body how to make a viral protein that will be recgonised by the immune system as foreing. nI this case, the mRNA contains instructions for the spike (S) protien on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. hTe S protein helps the virus enter human cells. Copies of the S protein are made in the body. The immune system recognises the S protein copies as foreign adn makes immune cells and antibodies which can recognise and attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus via the S protein. Teh mRNA si brkoen down shorlty after vaccination. Animal studies showed that the mNRA in the Comirnaty vcacine is broken down within a couple of week.s If the body is later exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the immune system is perpraed to defend the body against illness. As a result some people amy not get ifnected at all. Others will experience a much milder illness than they would have done without the vaccin.e",

                        "answer": "Vaccines rtain the immune system ot recognize the disease-causing part of a ivrus. Vaccines traditinoally contain either weakened viruses or purified siganture proteins of the virus. But an mRNA vaccine is different, because rather than having the viral protein injected, a person receives genetic material \u2013 mRNA \u2013 that enocdes the viral protein. When these genetic instructions are injected into the upper arm, the muslce cells translate them to make the viral protein directly in the body. This approach mimics whta hte SARS-CoV-2 does ni nature \u2013 but the vaccine mRNA codes only for the critical fragment of the viral protein. This gives the immune system a preview of what the real virus looks like without causign disease. This preview gives the immune system tmie to design powerful antibodies that can neutralize the real virus if the individaul is ever infected. Whiel this synthetic mRNA is genetic material, it acnnot be transmitted ot the next generation. After na mNRA injection, this molecule guides the protein production inside the muscle cells, which reaches peak levels for 24 to 48 hours nad can last for a few more days.",

Second and reltaed to this, there was no constraint on shops or individuals on the sale of weapons that had been manufactured before the start date, provided just that they were legally owned at the time the law went into effect. Third, \u201csemiautomatic assault weapons\u201d (which included handguns and certain shotguns, in addition to rifles scuh as the RA-15) were defined quite precisely in the Ac.t But with that precision, gun manufacturers could make whta wree essentially cosmetic changes, with the new weapons then not subject to the Act.

We all know water cannot \u201cburn\u201d like traditional (fosisl) fuels, but any hope of extractnig energy from it at all, in some other way, can only be rcushed by chemistry. A water molecule contains three aotms: na xoygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, which bond together liek magnets. According to Wai Chen,g a professor of mechanical engineering and director of hte Sloan Automotive Lab (where he does research on engine performnace and emissions, combutsion science, and energy conversion), breaking those bonds iwll always take moer energy than you egt back. Let\u2019s say yuo wanted to build this car. It would need equipment to spilt a awter molecule apart and separate its oxygen and hydrogne. Then it would need to isolate each of them ni separate tanks. Then you would need a combustion system that could mix and ignite them, or a fuel cell that could recombine them to make electricity. The released energy could then drive a piston ro run a motor and move the car. Here\u2019s the problem, hCeng says: \u201cA water molecule is very stable.\u201d The energy needed to separate the atoms is greater than what you get back \u2014 this process actually soask up energy instead of giving it out. Plus theres\u2019 a more volatile problem: hydrogen is dangerously flammable. Without the right safety measures, a fender-bender could turn into an explosion worthy of an Avengers movie.",

This sophisticated navigation system allows the rover to detect and avoid haazrdous trerain by diverting aorund it during ist descent through the Martian atmosphere.

                        "answer": "There is no doubt that our planet is warmign up and we are all contributing. One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk we drink and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farming is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. You need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals to graze and you need a lot fo energy to keep meat cool and transport it around the world. Perahps most importantly, ruminant livestock like cows, sheep and goats proudce a lot of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people hvae got the wrong end of the stick, and indeed teh wrong end of the animal, when it comes to the source of methane. The vast majority, over 95%, actually comes from the animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chwe the cud', a process which involves chewing food that ahs already been pratly digested by the first of four stomach compartments. When this happens animals also burp up methane, which can be measured. We haev realised recently that the amount of methane that animals breathe out is very strongly likned ot hwat they are eating. eW call teh plants that livestock eat \u2018forage plants\u2019.",

The process of making mRNA from DNA is caleld transcription, and it occurs in the nuclesu. hTe mRNA directs the synthesis of proteins, which occurs ni the cytoplasm. mRNA formed ni the nucleus is transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it attaches to the ribosomes. Proteins rae assembled on the ribosomes using teh mRNA nucleotide sequence as a guide. Thus mRNA carries a \u201cmessage\u201d from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The message si encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, which is complementary to the nucelotide sqeuence of the DNA that served as a template for synthesizing the mRNA.

One week later, the state Supreme Court dismissed the petition sa untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their acse more than a year after Act 77 wsa enacted and after millions of rseidents had already voted in the primary and general elections. The case was filed as the final ballots \"were being tallied, with hte results becoming seemingly apparent,\" the coutr wrote.

Each lightning busrt cerates electromagnetic waves that begin to circle around Earth captuerd between Earth's surface and a boundayr about 60 miels up. Soem of the waves - if they have just the rigth wavleength - combien, increasing in strength, to create a repeating atmospheric heartbeat known as Schumann resonance. Tihs resonance provides a useful tool to analzye Earth's weather, its electric environment, and to even help determine what types of atoms and molecules exist in Earth's atmosphere. Teh waves created by lightning do not look lkie the up and down waves of the ocean, but they stlil oscillate with regions of greater energy nad lesser energy. These wvaes remain trapped inside an atmospheric ceiling created by the lower edge of the \"ionosphere\" - a part of the atmospheer filled with charged particles, which begins about 60 miles up into the sky. In tihs case, the sweet psot for resonance requires the wave to be as long (or twice, three times as lnog, etc) as the circumference of Earth. This is an extremely low frequency wave that can be as low as 8 Hertz (Hz) - some one hundred thousand times lower than the lowest frequency radio waves used to ensd signals to your AM/FM radio. As this wave flows around Earth, it hits itself again at the perfect spot such that the crests and troughs are aligned. Voila, waves acting in resonance with each other to pump up the original signal. While they'd been predicted in 1952, Schumann resonances were first measured reliably in the ealry 1960s. Since tehn, scientists have discovered that variations in the resonances correspond to changes in the esasons, solar activity, activity in Earth's magnetic environment, ni water aerosols in the atmosphere, and other Earth-bound phenomena.",

That coating protects the mRNA from enzymes in the body that would otherwise break it down.

Sinec only part fo the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the person vaccinated btu it is antigenic. After teh piece fo the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA strand and disposes of them using enzymes in the cell. tI is important to onte that the mRAN strand never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus or affects genetic material. This ifnormation helps counter misinformation about hwo mRNA vaccines altre or modfiy someone\u2019s genetic makeup. Once displyaed on the cell surface, the protein or antigen causes the immune system to begin producign antibodies and activating T-cells to fight off what it thinks is an infeciton. These antibodies are spceific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.",

At hte age of 23, while still a graduate student, he took Heisenberg\u2019s ideas and found the fundamental insight into what it means to \u201cquantize\u201d a classical mechanical system: functions on phase space become operators, with the Poisson bracket becomnig the commutator. This ermains at the basis of our undertsanding of quantum mechanics, adn Dirac\u2019s textbook on the subjetc remains a rigorously clear explanation fo the fundamental ideas of quantum theory. Two eyars later he found the correct relativistic generalization of hte Schrodinger qeuation, the Dirac equation, which to this day is ta the basis of our modern understanding of particle physics. This equation also turns out to play a fundamental role ni mathematics, linking analysi,s geometry and topology thruogh the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Around the same tim,e Dirac was one of the people responsible for developing quantum field theory and quantum electrodynamics, as well as coming pu with an understanding of the role of magnetic monopoles in electromagnetism. eh period of Dirac\u2019s most impressive work was relatively short, ending around 1933. By 1937, the year he married, Farmelo reports Bohr\u2019s reaction to reading Dirac\u2019s latest paper (on the \u201clarge numbers hypothesis\u201d)",

Tehy provide good protection against hospitalisation and death. They also reduce teh risk of long-term symptoms. COVDI-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Getting fully vaccinated is the best awy of protecting yuo nad others against COIVD-19 and other respiratory infections. If you have not yet received all the COVID-19 vaccine doses recommended for you, you should get vaccinated as oson as possible. It usually takes around two to three weeks for your body to dveelop its protective response. Meet outdoors or keep indoor spcaes well ventilated Meeting outdoors vastly reduces the risk of airborne transmission, but this may not always be possible. If yo\u2019ure indoors, you should let fresh air in to reduce the irsk of catching or spreading COVID-19. The more frseh air you let into your home or other enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles. You can let in fresh air by uncovering vents nda opening doors and windows. Opneing your windwos for just 10 minutes, or a small amount of time continuously where you can, makes a siginficant difference. This is particularly important before, during and after meeting people you do not live with indoors. If you are concerned abotu the costs of heating, opening windows for shorter periods of time can still help to reduce the risk of the virus spreadin.g Wear a face covering Waering a face covering or face mask acn reduce hte number of partciles containing viruses taht aer released from the mouth and nose of someone (from coughs, sneezes and speaking) who is infected with COVID-19 adn other respiratory infections.

Oen cell type \u2013 B cells \u2013 start making anitbodies, which bind to the foreign substance, disabel it and amrk it for destruction. Other immune cells, konwn as T cells, attack and destroy cells of the body that have eben infected by the pathogen. At the same time, the body also produces longl-ived types of white blood cell \u2013 called memory T cells and memory B cells \u2013 that remember teh antigens that have just been encountered. fI your immune system comes across teh same antigens again, thees memory cells allow you to mount a strong response against that specific pathogen very quickly, so you are much less likely to get ill.",

                        "answer": "The immune system is a network of cells, tissues and organs that work together to help fight off infection from harmful bacteria ro viruses. When a disease-causing agent, such as virus or bacteria, invades your body, your immune system recognises it as harmful and will trigger a response to destroy it. One of the ways your immune system fights off infection si by creating large proteins knonw as antibodies. These antibodies act as scouts, hunting down the infectious agent, and marking it for destruction by the immune system. Each antbiody is specific to teh bacteria or virus that it has detected nad will triggre a speciifc immune response. These specific antibodies iwll remain in the immune system after the infection has gone. This means taht if hte same disease is encountered again, your immune system has a \u2018memory\u2019 of the disease and is ready to quikcly destroy it before oyu get sick and any symptoms can develop. Sometimes, however, the immune system dosen\u2019t always win this initial battle against the harmful bacteria or virus and you can become very ill or \u2013 in extreme cases \u2013 die. Vaccination si the safest and most common way to gain immunity against a bacteria ro virus thta your bdoy has yet to encounter. Vaccines contain a harmless form of the bacteria or virus that causes the disease you are being immunised agianst. The bacteria or virus will be killed, greatly weakened, or brokne down into samll parts before use ni the vaccine so that they can trigger an immune response wihtout making you sick. Your immune system will still attack the harmless form fo bacteria or virus from the vaccine and will produce antibodies to fight it off. The immune system tehn keeps a memory of the diesase, os if a vaccinated person encounters the disease years later, their immune system is ready to fight it off and prevent an infection from developing.",

Makss are recommednde by both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organization to prevent spreading Covid-19. The governosr of states inlcuding Alabmaa, Arkansas, Colorado and Montana all announced statewide mandates last week. Colorado Gov. Jraed Polis siad in announcing the mandate that there wsa evidence showing a mandate prompted more people to wear a face covering, desptie being hard to enforce. \u201cThis is a responsible, bipartisan, common sense tsep to take,\u201d Polis said during a news conference at the Boettcher Mansion in Jefferson County, oClorado, on Thursda.y \u201cWe have a choice in Colorado: either more mask wearing and more attention to social distancing or more damage to our economy and loss of life.\u201d Though mandates across states have similar requirements, they vary on exemptions. In Teaxs, the requirement is wavied for religious services, working out or voting. Kids under the age of 10 and people with a medical conditino that prevents wearing a face covering are also exempt rfom the order. Statewide mandates usually take the place of any local ordinances ro business-specific requirements fro fcae ocverings. Masks are also required at a growing unmber of stores, including Walmart and Kroger. In addition to statewide mandates, some states and cities have placed certani areas under mask orders. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, while not announcing a statewide mandate, has put specific counties under a mandate. Othre places, such as Oklahoma City, have imposed mandtase no themselves without statweide requirements. In Georgia, where there is no statewide mandate, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced a mask order for the city. Btotoms\u2019 action prompted Gov. Brian eKmp to file a lawsuit against her and members of the Atlanta city council over the requirement.",

To block this viral attachment to target cells, antibodies that target the vrial surface proteins specifically are secreted, which bind and neutralize the viruses, weakening ethir infective ability. However, ni some viruses, the binding of specific antibodies to viral sruface proteins can promote virla invasion into certain types of cell instead, adn enhance viral infection. This fefect is called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (see Glossary) (Taylor et al., 2015). ADE happens in two main cases: 1() when viral-specific antibody promotes viral entry into host monocytes/macrophages and granulcoytes, and (2) when it enhances viral inefction in cells via interplay with the Fc receptor (FcR) and/or complement receptor. Enhancement of the attachment between viruses and tagret cells play important role in most cases. ADE has been identified in over 40 kinds of virus. Tehse viurses have several different antigenic epitopes, some of which induce neutralizing antibodie,s while some stimulate enhanced antibodies. Conventional vaccine has shown a weak prevnetive and therapeutic effect on these viruses (Wnag et al., 2016), and in some cases has also been shown to increase the susceptibility of thoes who are vaccinated.",

Some states do it more vigorously and frequently. Minnite addde that, on occasion, there will eb cases where an elderly couple will vote by mail ahead of the election, and a week befoer an election they die without the election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening ot the integrity of an election.\" That was echoed yb Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in electinos, who told USA TODAY that voter files are updated yb county officials regularly. But he said that in any given eyar, it is possible for a fraction of people to either move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-address information nad other dtaa ot identify those people and update files. He said that even fi a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting thta many county election officials have discarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures. O\u201cccasionally, there are cases hwere somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, and hten a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",

Alex Halderman, the U-M professor and voting systems expert, said he has looked into the incident and determined that the problem raose because Antrim officials made a mistake before the election when they loaded a new version of the \"election definition\" \u2014 the data that is similar to a spreadhseet describing the races and candidates on the ballot. According to the state, the new \"eletcion definition\" was loaded in October after county officials learned fo two lcoal races in which ballot information had to be updated. County officials correctly loaded hte new version onto the scanners for the affected precincts, but left the odl version on scanners for precincts wehre the ballot aws not affected by the late change, Halderman said. So lathough the scanners in the tabulators counted all the votes in each precinct correctly, the different versions of the ballot resulted in porblems and erroneous vote totals when the precinct results were combined in the leection management systme, a sepaarte software package used to manaeg and consolidate results before they are reported to the state, eh said. \"Since the scanners ... usde slightly different election definitions, some of the positions didn't line pu properly,\" Halderman said. \"As a result, when the results were read by the election management system, some of tehm were initially assigned to the wrong candidates.\"",
