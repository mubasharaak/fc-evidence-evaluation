J&J said Friday that in the U.S. and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective \u2014 85% \u2014 against the most serious symptoms. There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the U.S. - 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 \u2013 compared to 57% in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus. \"Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press. With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.\\ But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95% effective after two doses, at question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly. The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light. These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn't completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination \u2014 about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to \"regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants,\" Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95% protective after the second dose. But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection. All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. J&J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna. It's not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70% effective although there is little data available on how much protection older adults get, specifically. An ongoing U.S. study may provide more information. J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40% had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV. J&J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other COVID-19 shots such as fever that occur when the immune system is revved up. While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated \u2014 and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used. J&J had hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine, which is still underway. Friday's interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89% effective in a U.K. study and that it also seems to work \u2014 though not as well \u2014 against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the U.S. and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers."

                "scraped_text": "Four reasons why we need multiple vaccines for Covid-19 Having a range of Covid-19 vaccines available for people to use around the world is essential to bring the pandemic under control. With several highly effective Covid-19 vaccines already in use, why is it important to keep working on and investing in the vaccines still in development? 1. We need a range of vaccines that can work for a range of people We need Covid-19 vaccines to work for a diverse range of people. At this stage, we are still collecting data to understand how effective the vaccines are for people of all ages, from different ethnic backgrounds, with different immune systems; and how well they work against different variants of the virus. We are also still investigating how long immunity might last for, and how effective the vaccines are at preventing transmission of the disease. With questions like these remaining, we can\u2019t rely on a small number of vaccines to help us respond to Covid-19. And it might be that one vaccine is not as effective or suitable for everyone. We often need multiple vaccines for a disease to be able to protect different groups of people. For example, last winter the UK used four different flu vaccines. Which vaccine was given depended on a person\u2019s risk group and how their immune system might respond \u2013 the vaccine given to a teenager with a robust immune system was not the same as that given to someone over the age of 65. Vaccines are a bit like different painkillers: aspirin, paracetamol, ibuprofen: they all have the same goal, they just achieve it in slightly different ways. If we have a varied Covid-19 vaccine portfolio, we can be confident we will find the right vaccine for every person. Anna Mouser, Policy & Advocacy Lead, Vaccines: Could you say a little bit about why we need different types of vaccines? Professor Luke O'Neill, Chair of Biochemistry, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland: It's really about shots on goal, to use a football analogy. The more shots on goal you have, the more chance you have that one of them will work. All these labs all over the world went after their favourite way to do it, and the Oxford group, for instance, with AstraZeneca, they had a specific idea there. The Moderna group in America, BioNTech in Germany, Johnson & Johnson, many labs began to use different approaches. So we are expecting at least five vaccines in the coming months all using slightly different techniques and they all might work great. They all might have different properties in the end. Some might work better in older people, say or certainly if you want to get the vaccine out to the developing world, which is extremely important, we've got to get this vaccine used all over the world.. Those room-temperature ones may make it more feasible to use in say, Africa. 2. We need to produce billions of vaccine doses to protect those most at risk To be able to get control of the virus we need to produce and roll out vaccines at a scale and speed never seen before. To meet the aim of vaccinating high-risk populations around the world by the end of 2021, we need at least 2 billion vaccine doses. Companies are scaling up production as much as they can, for example Moderna have stated they hope to produce 800 million to 1 billion doses of their vaccine in 2021. However, as we\u2019ve already seen, there may be manufacturing issues and export delays which limit a vaccines\u2019 availability. And because many countries have pre-ordered large quantities of the vaccines, a large share of the initial production is already spoken for. By developing and investing in multiple vaccine candidates we stand a much better chance of having the volume of doses we need to help contain the virus. 3. We need vaccines that can reach everyone, everywhere We will need to get Covid-19 vaccines to everyone who needs them, wherever they are \u2013 from people living in metropolitan areas and cities, to rural populations in remote corners of the world. Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines need to be stored and transported at exceptionally low temperatures: the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at -70C and the Moderna vaccine at -20C, to ensure they stay viable. In comparison, most childhood vaccines require storage at between 2C to 8C, similar to the temperature in a domestic fridge. The requirements for cold storage and transportation will be difficult to meet in many locations, and no vaccine requiring such cold storage has ever been rolled out to so many countries, all at once. In addition, both RNA vaccines currently have a relatively high cost per dose, although this could reduce once large-scale production and supply chains are in place. The news that other vaccines \u2013 such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines \u2013 cost significantly less has been widely welcomed. It is hoped that other highly effective vaccines will be offered at a lower cost. Dosing creates an additional challenge. Most approved vaccines to date require two doses, spaced weeks apart. Developing effective single-dose vaccines will be critical to protect people for whom getting two doses might be difficult, such as those without access to regular healthcare, or refugees. Some manufacturers are currently developing single dose vaccines, and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s has recently been approved for use. These vaccines could mark a turning point in global vaccine access. These technical considerations mean it is vital that we continue to develop and invest in multiple vaccine candidates, which may be able to offer high levels of efficacy without the need for such cold storage or multiple doses. 4. We need vaccines that are available to all countries and supported through COVAX To overcome the pandemic, people all around the world must have access to vaccines, treatments and tests. However, many of the vaccines being developed are being bought up by countries making deals directly with pharmaceutical companies for their populations. As of April 2021, governments in high-income countries had purchased 56% of the world\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine supply, despite representing only 16% of the global population. And, although almost 2 billion vaccine doses have now been given across the world, most of them have been given in countries with the highest incomes. The best and fastest way to achieve a more equitable distribution of vaccines lies in the hands of countries that have ordered more doses than they need. They can do this, alongside their own national rollouts, through the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX), a multilateral effort to make sure that poorer countries are not frozen out of access to vaccines.

                "question": "What type of COVID-19 vaccine has Johnson & Johnson developed regarding dosing?",
                "url": "https://www.phoebehealth.com/patients-and-visitors/coronavirus/vaccine-faq",
                "scraped_text": "I can\u2019t remember which vaccine I received for the first dose? What do I do? If you are 18 years or older you may choose which COVID-19 vaccine you receive as a booster shot. Some people may prefer the vaccine type that they originally received, and others may prefer to get a different booster. CDC\u2019s recommendations now allow for this type of mix and match dosing for booster shots. COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us actually contracting the virus. For more information on how vaccines work, visit CDC.gov. The COVID-19 vaccine is being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standard as all other types of vaccines in the United States. The only COVID-19 vaccines the FDA will make available for use in the United States (by approval or emergency use authorization) are those that meet these standards. Are there differences in the vaccines \u2013 Pfizer, Moderna and J&J? Yes, there are differences between the three vaccines from development, required number of doses, and potential side effects. Please visit CDC.gov for more information on each of the vaccines. How many doses of the vaccine will I need to take? The number of doses needed depends on which vaccine you receive. To get the most protection: - Two Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine doses should be given 3 weeks (21 days) apart. - Two Moderna vaccine doses should be given 1 month (28 days) apart. - Johnson & Johnsons Jansen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 vaccine requires only one dose. If you receive a vaccine that requires two doses, you should get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible. You should not get the second dose earlier than the recommended interval. Absolutely. The data supports two doses (21-28 days apart, based on which vaccine is administered) as the most effective delivery of the vaccine. It is critically important that anyone who receives the first dose is 100% committed to receiving a second dose. The FDA and CDC are continually expanding eligibility and evaluating data regarding timeframe for administration of the booster. Side effects have been mild to moderate and short-lived after receiving the vaccine - similar to other vaccination side effects. An exception may be for those who have had serious allergic reactions to vaccines/medications in the past. Is paralysis a side effect of the COVID-19 Vaccine? There is no data that links paralysis to being a side effect of the vaccine. There were seven clinical trial participants that experience facial paralysis. However, this quantity is no higher than the number of people who experience facial paralysis in the general population without receiving the vaccine. Any paralysis that occurs after receiving the vaccine should be reported to VAERS. What should I do if I experience side effects after receiving the vaccine? If you experience any serious adverse side effect after receiving the vaccine, call 911. Reporting directly to the CDC through the v-safe app, http://vsafe.cdc.gov, or calling 1-800-822-7967 is also recommended. Can I take over-the-counter pain medication to ease vaccine symptoms? It is not recommended to take over-the-counter Acetaminophen or non-steroid anti-inflammatory medication prior to receiving the vaccine. However, they may be taken for treatment of post-vaccination symptoms, if medically appropriate. Will I contract COVID-19 from the COVID-19 vaccine? The data says no. Sometimes vaccinations can cause some symptoms, such as fever, but these symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. Vaccine development is complex and fascinating \u2013 you can learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work at CDC.gov. Can a person who has received the COVID-19 vaccine still spread COVID-19? Yes, fully vaccinated people can be carriers of the COVID-19 virus. A fully-vaccinated individual should follow safety guidelines provided by the CDC. Will the COVID-19 vaccines cause a positive test result on COVID-19 viral tests? No. COVID-19 vaccines won\u2019t cause you to test positive on viral tests, which are used to see if you have a current infection. If your body develops an immune response, which is the goal of vaccination, there is a possibility you may test positive on some antibody tests which are used to indicate if you have had a previous infection. Experts are still looking at how the COVID-19 vaccination may affect antibody testing results, but there is little concern about creating false positives for current infection tests. Antibody tests check your blood for antibodies, which may tell you if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections and can provide protection against getting that disease again (immunity). Antibodies are disease specific. For example, measles antibodies will protect you from getting measles if you are exposed to it again, but they won\u2019t protect you from getting mumps if you are exposed to mumps. Antibody tests should not be used to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection, except in instances in which viral testing is delayed. An antibody test may not show if you have a current COVID-19 infection, because it can take 1\u20133 weeks after infection for your body to make antibodies. Should I receive the vaccine after receiving monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma? Currently, there is not data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in a person who have received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma. Vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days, as a precautionary measure to avoid potential interference of the antibody therapy with vaccine-induced immune responses. This recommendation applies to persons who receive passive antibody therapy before receiving any vaccine doses as well as those who receive passive antibody therapy after the first dose but before the second dose, in which case the second dose would be deferred for at least 90 days following receipt of the antibody therapy. A viral test checks fluid or blood samples to find out if you are currently infected with COVID-19. The time it takes to process these tests can vary, so results may not be available for a few days. Patients can visit state or local health department websites for the latest information on testing, or you can call your healthcare provider. I\u2019ve already had COVID-19, should I still get the vaccine? Yes. Re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, so people are advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have had COVID-19 before. However, it is recommended you wait 14 days from last positive test. I haven\u2019t had COVID-19, but I\u2019ve been recently exposed. Should I receive the vaccine? If you have knowingly been exposed to COVID-19, you should not seek vaccination until your quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing individuals during a vaccination appointment. Does the vaccine help prevent getting sick with COVID-19? Yes, that is the vaccine\u2019s core purpose. While many people with COVID-19 only experience mild illness, some suffer from severe illness or may even die. There is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you are not at increased risk of complications. If you get sick, you also may spread the disease to friends, family, and others around you while you are sick. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness. Learn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work at CDC.gov. Do I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others if I have received two doses of the vaccine? Yes. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to use to help stop this pandemic, like covering your mouth and nose with a mask, washing hands often, and staying at least 6 feet away from others. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. Information about the current variants is rapidly emerging. Scientists are working to learn more about how easily it might spread and whether they could cause more severe illness. Do COVID-19 variants alter the COVID-19 Vaccine effectiveness? There is no evidence that the variants are changing the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. Most experts believe this is unlikely to occur because of the nature of the immune response to the virus. I have an autoimmune condition, should I take the COVID-19 vaccine? If you do not have allergic reactions to other vaccines, you may receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Should I wait to take the COVID-19 vaccine after I have received the flu vaccine? The data shows that the two vaccines do not counter react each other. You can receive both vaccines at the same time and not affect the effectiveness for either. I\u2019m on birth control. Do I need to use a specific type of vaccine? People using hormonal birth control can receive any FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine. There are no recommendations to stop taking hormonal birth control (birth control pills, implant, patch, ring, or shot) before or after receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine. Yes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly recommends all pregnant women who do not have a medical contraindication receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Should I plan my mammogram or breast exam around the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. All vaccines can potentially cause swollen lymph nodes in some women. When your radiologist sees a swollen lymph node during a mammogram, that can be a cause for concern and warrants a follow-up exam. Experts are trying to avoid false positives and unnecessary anxiety. They suggest either scheduling a mammogram before a vaccine, or 4 to 6 weeks afterwards. Is it safe for my child to get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. Studies show that COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Like adults, children (ages 5 - 17) may have some side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. These side effects may affect their ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. COVID-19 vaccination can help protect your child from getting COVID-19. Getting your child vaccinated helps to protect your child and your family. Vaccination is now recommended for everyone 5 years and older. Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is the only one available to children 5 years and older. For more information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines, please speak to your primary care physician or visit CDC.gov."

And the J&J shot is on the verge of its next big step forward. The pharma giant is in the \u201cfinal stages\u201d of data analysis for its phase 3 trial, CEO Alex Gorsky said Monday at the annual J.P. Morgan healthcare conference. The company hopes \u201cto have that information very soon,\u201d he added. J&J initially set out to test its adenovirus-based vaccine candidate in a 60,000-patient phase 3 trial, but it halted enrollment at around 45,000 patients last month. Now, it\u2019s nearly ready to deliver its first efficacy numbers\u2014and find out how they stack up against the other vaccines in the mix. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines posted efficacy numbers better than 90%. AstraZeneca's vaccine was 70% effective on average, but a half-dose regimen was 90% effective, the company reported in November. Gorsky\u2019s JPM remarks come after Operation Warp Speed official Moncef Slaoui recently predicted J&J efficacy data in January and a potential FDA emergency authorization in February. Importantly, J&J\u2019s vaccine works with just one dose, which Slaoui said could be a \u201cgame-changer,\u201d as quoted by the New York Post. The drugmaker is also testing its shot as a two-dose regimen. RELATED: AstraZeneca, J&J COVID-19 shots must succeed to meet U.S. vaccination goal: Slaoui While J&J\u2019s candidate didn\u2019t beat the mRNA shots from Pfizer and Moderna to the market, the company\u2019s program could still play a crucial role in expanding vaccine access in the U.S. and beyond. As of Monday, about 7 million vaccine doses were administered in the U.S., and the nationwide rollout has gotten off to a slower-than-expected start. But it's not just about developing a vaccine, Gorsky said Monday. The company is also focused on production and is \u201con track\u201d to deliver hundreds of millions of doses in the first half of 2021. In all of 2021, the drugmaker intends to produce nearly 1 billion doses. RELATED: JPM, Day 1: Moderna's 'inflection year,' Gilead's Veklury boost, Genentech's 'silver linings\u2019 Aside from J&J, other vaccine developers\u2014including late-stage players Novavax and AstraZeneca\u2014will be aiming to score U.S. authorizations in 2021. Novavax plans to report interim phase 3 data in the first quarter and is already stockpiling doses in the event the program wins regulatory green lights, CEO Stan Erck said at the virtual JPM conference Monday. Since the start of last year, Novavax has established a worldwide manufacturing network that will be able to produce 2 billion vaccine doses per year, Erck added."

A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 per cent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV. While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other COVID-19 vaccines trigger such reactions which can be reversed if promptly treated, and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used. Friday's interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 per cent effective in a UK study and that it also seems to work \u2014 though not as well \u2014 against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa."

                "scraped_text": "A third Covid-19 vaccine, one made by Johnson & Johnson, could be authorized for use in the United States in the near future. Data about the single-shot vaccine released Friday, and the company is now collating its data to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization. The vaccine was made through a collaboration of J&J\u2019s Belgium-based vaccine division, Janssen Pharmaceutical, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and it works a bit differently. Here\u2019s what\u2019s known about how it works and how it will fit into the mix of vaccines. Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, the company announced Friday. The vaccine is 85% effective overall at preventing hospitalization and death in all regions where it was tested. Its efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from one country to another: 72% in the US, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa. This was measured starting one month after the shot. In South Africa, 95% of cases in the trial were due to a variant known as B.1.351, which is known to be more contagious and carries mutations that may make the virus less susceptible to the antibody immune response \u2013 including antibodies prompted by vaccination. Even those who got moderate cases of Covid-19 in the trial tended to develop a milder course and fewer symptoms, said Dr. Mathai Mammen, Janssen\u2019s global head of research and development. From one month after the shot, all hospitalizations and deaths occurred in the placebo group. The J&J vaccine is what is known as a non-replicating viral vector vaccine, using a common cold virus called adenovirus 26. Scientists made this vaccine by taking a small amount of genetic material that codes for a piece of the novel coronavirus and integrating it with a weakened version of adenovirus 26. J&J scientists altered this adenovirus so it can enter cells, but it cannot replicate and make people sick. AstraZeneca uses a similar platform, but its adenovirus comes from a chimpanzee. The adenovirus carries the genetic material from the coronavirus into human cells, tricking them into making pieces of the coronavirus spike protein \u2013 the part it uses to attach to cells. The immune system then reacts against these pieces of the coronavirus. \u201cSo you\u2019re not being infected with the virus that can give you Covid-19 when you get this vaccine. It just has some of the harmless Covid virus proteins on its surface,\u201d explained Dr. William Schaffner, an internist and infectious disease specialist with Vanderbilt University\u2019s Department of Health Policy. \u201cSo essentially it\u2019s a sheep in wolf\u2019s clothing, and when your immune system sees it, it responds to it and creates protection against it and in the future, against the real virus that causes Covid-19.\u201d The technology used in the Covid-19 vaccine has worked with the Ebola vaccine by Janssen. How is it different from the other Covid-19 vaccines? Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the Moderna, Pfizer and J&J Covid-19 vaccines all take a similar approach, but there is a small difference with the J&J approach. \u201cIn the case of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccine you\u2019re just giving the gene in a lipid nanoparticle or a fat droplet,\u201d Offit said. \u201cIn the case of J&J you\u2019re giving the gene in a virus that can\u2019t reproduce itself.\u201d The J&J vaccine is the only Covid-19 vaccine so far to be given in a single dose. Moderna and Pfizer\u2019s use two. Like Moderna\u2019s, it can also be kept at regular refrigerated temperatures and does not need a deep freeze like Pfizer\u2019s. A single dose and would be much easier to administer and would mean more people could be vaccinated, as none would need to be set aside to give someone a second shot. \u201cThis advantage goes up in neon,\u201d said Schaffner who believes adding a vaccine like this would \u201creally accelerate\u201d vaccination efforts in the US and around the world. \u201cIf it\u2019s a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,\u201d said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop Johnson & Johnson\u2019s vaccine candidate on CNN\u2019s Coronavirus Fact vs. Fiction podcast. &J\u2019s other advantage is that it can be stored at regular refrigerator temperatures, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which needs special deep freezers. The vaccine is stable for up to three months at 36 degrees F to 46 degrees F, the company said. That means health care facilities would not have to buy extra equipment to safely store the vaccine. \u201cIf they\u2019re successful, these vaccines would especially be popular in the developing world, because they would be easy to store and administer,\u201d said Dr. Rafi Ahmed, the director of the Vaccine Center at Emory University. The vaccines would also be popular in rural communities in the US and regular doctor\u2019s offices that may not have access or the budget to afford specialized equipment. \u201cIn other words, we could bring the vaccine to the people,\u201d Schaffner said, \u201crather than bringing the people to the vaccine.\u201d The company will request what\u2019s known as an emergency use authorization, or an EUA, from the FDA in early February. The data will get a close look from the FDA and advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While the FDA is reviewing the data, it schedules a public meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. The committee is made up of independent science and public health experts who will discuss the J&J data and make a recommendation to the agency. Once an application is submitted, \u201cThe FDA really looks very, very carefully at the data in each age group and in each demographic group,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a call on Friday. After the meeting, FDA staff members consider the committee input along with the agency\u2019s evaluation of the company\u2019s data and will make a decision about whether the vaccine should by authorized. Shortly after an EUA, the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, also known as ACIP, goes through the data, too. Once the CDC committee has made a recommendation and it has been approved by the CDC director, the company plans to ship the vaccines immediately and it can go into arms right away. Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. The process for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be about the same as it was for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, according Offit, who is a member of the FDA\u2019s VRBPAC. With the Pfizer vaccine, it took a little over three weeks from the time the company submitted its data to an EUA. With the Moderna vaccine, it took a little more than two weeks. If the vaccine is authorized for emergency use, \u201cour plan is to have supply immediately upon launch,\u201d Mammen said. The US has ordered 100 million doses and the company has been manufacturing it while it has been testing the vaccine. Typically, companies wait to make the vaccine after its been approved, but that changed during the pandemic. Johnson & Johnson says it can meet its 100 million dose commitment by June.

J&J said Friday that in the U.S. and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective \u2014 85% \u2014 against the most serious symptoms. There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the U.S. - 72% effective against moderate to severe COVID-19 \u2013 compared to 57% in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus. \"Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,\" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J's Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press. With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters.\\ But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95% effective after two doses, at question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly. The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the U.S., and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the U.S. by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light. These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn't completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination \u2014 about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to \"regular COVID or these particularly nasty variants,\" Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95% protective after the second dose. But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection. All COVID-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. J&J's shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna. It's not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70% effective although there is little data available on how much protection older adults get, specifically. An ongoing U.S. study may provide more information. J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40% had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe COVID-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV.

Matthew Miller, an associate professor at the Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University, told CBC News by email that the decision will depend on multiple factors, including \"the procurement timelines for specific vaccines in each country\" and how prevalent the newly circulating variants become. \"Some high-risk populations may need vaccines that confer higher degrees of protection, while less efficacious vaccines might be appropriate for lower-risk populations,\" he said.
