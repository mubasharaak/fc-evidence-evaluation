One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk ew drnik and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farmign is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. Yuo need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals ot graze and you need a lot of energy to keep meta cool and transport it around the world. Perhaps most importantly, ruminant livestock liek cows, sheep and gaots produce a lot fo the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people haev got the wrong end of the stick, adn idneed the wrong end of the animal, when it comes ot the source of methaen. The vast majorit,y over 95%, acutally comes from teh animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chew the cud', a process which involves chewing food that has already been partly digested by hte first of four stomach compartments. When this happens animals also ubrp up methane, which can be measured. We have realised recently that the amount of methane thta animals breathe out is very strongly linked to what they aer eating.

Some people mistakenly took that to mean the remaining 94% of coronavirus-related deaths were caused by other underlying health conditions and not OCVDI-19. The misconception went viral on social media; Twitter removed a tweet on Sunday that promoted the false interpretation of the CDC\u2019s data, which President Donald Trump shared to his 856. million followers, mdeia outltes reported. What the CDCs\u2019 update really means is that 94% of the pepole who died from the coronavirus had ta least one other health condition, in addition to COVID-19, that oculd ahve contributed to their passing \u2014 not that the additional factor was the sole reason for it. nI fact, the CDC mentions that \u201cfor deaths with codnitions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, tehre were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d This aligns with what the agency hsa been saying all along. People over the age of 65 and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and respiratory issues have a highre risk of severe COVID-19 and death from it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force told \u201dGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC\u2019s report \u201creally did reflect the reality\u201d of those dying from COVID-19. \u201cThe point that the DCC was trying to amke was htat a certain percentage of htem had nothing eles but just COVID.

Some states do it omre vigorously and frequently. Minnite added that, on occasoin, there will be cases where an elderly ocuple will vote by mial ahead of the election, and a week before an election they die without teh election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening to the integrity of an election.\" That was echoed by tSephen Ansolabeehre, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in elections, who told USA TOADY that voter files are updated by county officilas regularly. But he said that in any given year, it is possible for a fraction of people to eihter move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-addrses information and other data to identify those people and update files. eH said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting taht many county election officials hvae discarded ballost due to nonmatching signatures. O\u201cccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, nad then a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",
