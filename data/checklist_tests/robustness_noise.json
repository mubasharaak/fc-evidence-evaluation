One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk we drink and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farming is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. You need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals to graze and you need a lot of energy to keep meat cool and transport it around the world. Perhaps most importantly, ruminant livestock like cows, sheep and goats produce a lot of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people have got the wrong end of the stick, and indeed the wrong end of the animal, when it comes to the source of methane. The vast majority, over 95%, actually comes from the animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chew the cud', a process which involves chewing food that has already been partly digested by the first of four stomach compartments. When this happens animals also burp up methane, which can be measured. We have realised recently that the amount of methane that animals breathe out is very strongly linked to what they are eating. We call the plants that livestock eat \u2018forage plants\u2019.",

Since only part of the protein is made, it does not do any harm to the person vaccinated but it is antigenic.\n\nAfter the piece of the spike protein is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA strand and disposes of them using enzymes in the cell. It is important to note that the mRNA strand never enters the cell\u2019s nucleus or affects genetic material. This information helps counter misinformation about how mRNA vaccines alter or modify someone\u2019s genetic makeup.\n\nOnce displayed on the cell surface, the protein or antigen causes the immune system to begin producing antibodies and activating T-cells to fight off what it thinks is an infection. These antibodies are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which means the immune system is primed to protect against future infection.",

Dairy cows, buffalo, sheep and goats accounted for the rest.\n\nThose emissions, combined with emissions from all the other sectors of food production, aren't likely to go down anytime soon. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry and fishing have doubled over the past 50 years, according to the report. Emissions could go up by 30 percent by 2050.",

One of the main reasons is linked to the production of the food we eat, the milk we drink and even the shoes on our feet. This is because livestock farming is a major source of the greenhouse gases that are warming our planet. You need to chop down a lot of trees to make pasture for animals to graze and you need a lot of energy to keep meat cool and transport it around the world. Perhaps most importantly, ruminant livestock like cows, sheep and goats produce a lot of the potent greenhouse gas, methane.Most people have got the wrong end of the stick, and indeed the wrong end of the animal, when it comes to the source of methane. The vast majority, over 95%, actually comes from the animal\u2019s breath. This happens when animals 'chew the cud', a process which involves chewing food that has already been partly digested by the first of four stomach compartments. When this happens animals also burp up methane, which can be measured. We have realised recently that the amount of methane that animals breathe out is very strongly linked to what they are eating. We call the plants that livestock eat \u2018forage plants\u2019.",

You see your net salary at the end of the month reflecting on your hard earned money with overtimes, bank shifts and those weekend night outs and getaways you've missed because you're at work. But have you ever really taken a closer look on your payslip or do you just look on the bottom right hand corner of it to see how much you've been paid? Well, understanding how you are getting paid can guide you about when are the best days to book shifts, how taxes impact your earnings which may help with planning your finances accordingly. \n\n        NHS salary follows Agenda for Change which is the main pay system for NHS staff excluding doctors, senior managers and dentists. As an overseas nurse, you will start as a Pre-registered nurse on a Band 4 pay scale. Once you've passed the OSCE and NMC has granted your PIN, you can start to work and be paid as a Band 5. Being a newly qualified nurse, you will start on the lowest point of Band 5 pay scale. Salary for a point 1 Band 5 normally starts at \u00a325,655 per year and will increase annually provided you have completed your annual appraisal. \n\n     Looking at all the numbers in your payslip might be intimidating. But by deeply understanding what those numbers mean, you can spot if there are errors, if you\u2019ve been paid correctly and make better decisions about when to do extra work.  \n\nFor those who are exploring to work in the UK, this will also help you understand how much registered nurses are being paid and its coverage.",

Some states do it more vigorously and frequently. \n\nMinnite added that, on occasion, there will be cases where an elderly couple will vote by mail ahead of the election, and a week before an election they die without the election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening to the integrity of an election.\"\n\nThat was echoed by Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in elections, who told USA TODAY that voter files are updated by county officials regularly. But he said that in any given year, it is possible for a fraction of people to either move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-address information and other data to identify those people and update files.\n\nHe said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting that many county election officials have discarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, and then a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",

You see your net salary at the end of the month reflecting on your hard earned money with overtimes, bank shifts and those weekend night outs and getaways you've missed because you're at work. But have you ever really taken a closer look on your payslip or do you just look on the bottom right hand corner of it to see how much you've been paid? Well, understanding how you are getting paid can guide you about when are the best days to book shifts, how taxes impact your earnings which may help with planning your finances accordingly. \n\n        NHS salary follows Agenda for Change which is the main pay system for NHS staff excluding doctors, senior managers and dentists. As an overseas nurse, you will start as a Pre-registered nurse on a Band 4 pay scale. Once you've passed the OSCE and NMC has granted your PIN, you can start to work and be paid as a Band 5. Being a newly qualified nurse, you will start on the lowest point of Band 5 pay scale. Salary for a point 1 Band 5 normally starts at \u00a325,655 per year and will increase annually provided you have completed your annual appraisal. \n\n     Looking at all the numbers in your payslip might be intimidating. But by deeply understanding what those numbers mean, you can spot if there are errors, if you\u2019ve been paid correctly and make better decisions about when to do extra work.  \n\nFor those who are exploring to work in the UK, this will also help you understand how much registered nurses are being paid and its coverage.",

                        "answer": "A statistic from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about coronavirus deaths in the United States has sparked a wave of confusion on social media. COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, was the \u201conly cause mentioned\u201d on death certificates in 6% of deaths involving the virus, the CDC said last week. Some people mistakenly took that to mean the remaining 94% of coronavirus-related deaths were caused by other underlying health conditions and not COVID-19. The misconception went viral on social media; Twitter removed a tweet on Sunday that promoted the false interpretation of the CDC\u2019s data, which President Donald Trump shared to his 85.6 million followers, media outlets reported. What the CDC\u2019s update really means is that 94% of the people who died from the coronavirus had at least one other health condition, in addition to COVID-19, that could have contributed to their passing \u2014 not that the additional factor was the sole reason for it. In fact, the CDC mentions that \u201cfor deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death.\u201d This aligns with what the agency has been saying all along. People over the age of 65 and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease and respiratory issues have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death from it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force told \u201dGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC\u2019s report \u201creally did reflect the reality\u201d of those dying from COVID-19. \u201cThe point that the CDC was trying to make was that a certain percentage of them had nothing else but just COVID. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of COVID didn\u2019t die of COVID-19 \u2014 they did.\u201d \u201cSo, the numbers that you\u2019ve been hearing, the 180,000 plus deaths are real deaths from COVID-19.",

The tweet said the remaining 94% had \u201cother serious illnesses.\u201d Fauci told the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC guidance, last updated on Aug. 26, indicates that of the people who have died from the virus, \u201ca certain percentage of them had nothing else but just Covid.\u201d However, people with underlying illnesses also die from Covid-19, he said.

On Sunday, Twitter removed a post retweeted by Trump that claimed the CDC had \u201cquietly\u201d updated its guidance to indicate only 6% of the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll \u2014 roughly 9,000 deaths \u2014  was actually caused by the virus, according to a CNN report. The tweet said the remaining 94% had \u201cother serious illnesses.\u201d Fauci told the ABC program \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that the CDC guidance, last updated on Aug. 26, indicates that of the people who have died from the virus, \u201ca certain percentage of them had nothing else but just Covid.\u201d However, people with underlying illnesses also die from Covid-19, he said. That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn\u2019t die of Covid-19. They did,\u201d Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the program. \u201cSo the numbers you\u2019ve been hearing -- there are 180,000-plus deaths -- are real deaths from Covid-19. Let (there) not be any confusion about that. It\u2019s not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it\u2019s 180-plus-thousand deaths",

Some states do it more vigorously and frequently. \n\nMinnite added that, on occasion, there will be cases where an elderly couple will vote by mail ahead of the election, and a week before an election they die without the election official knowing, but that this is in no way \"threatening to the integrity of an election.\"\n\nThat was echoed by Stephen Ansolabehere, a professor of government at Harvard University and an expert in elections, who told USA TODAY that voter files are updated by county officials regularly. But he said that in any given year, it is possible for a fraction of people to either move or die. He added that almost every election office uses national change-of-address information and other data to identify those people and update files.\n\nHe said that even if a dead person is sent a ballot, signature requirements are another round of fraud protections, noting that many county election officials have discarded ballots due to nonmatching signatures.\n\n\u201cOccasionally, there are cases where somebody orders an absentee ballot and passes away, and then a relative goes ahead and votes that ballot,\u201d Ansolabehere said.",
