It recommends that people wear a face covering or mask to cover their nose and mouth when in the community. This is another public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to social or physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and other preventive actions.

The CDC Trusted Source recommends healthcare workers wear face masks when working with patients who have the flu.

The CDC also recommendsTrusted Source patients who show signs of respiratory infections be given masks while they’re in healthcare settings until they can be isolated.

If you’re sick and need to be around others, properly wearing a mask can protect those around you from contracting the virus and developing an illness.Wearing a mask keeps the coronavirus from spreading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says masks are one of the most powerful tools available we have.

Masks don’t just prevent the spread of coronavirus. They can also prevent the spread of the flu, the common cold, and other respiratory diseases.

Question: What have studies found about the effectiveness of mask use in preventing the spread of COVID-19?
Answer: A study on ""Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection, and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China,"" found that face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79).In a study called ""The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,"" the findings indicated that ""our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% CI: 1.9–2.6) to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5–4.3)  after imposing lockdown."" A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, P < 0.05 vs after lockdown: r = 0.91, P = NS).

Conclusions: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases were observed, which are most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high-risk areas seems to have the potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.In a study called ""Is the lockdown important to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic? Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective,"" the lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and this study demonstrated that this preventive restriction can significantly reduce virus spread. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown.

Question: Do lockdowns slow down the spread of COVID-19?
Answer: Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as ‘lockdowns’, can slow COVID‑19 transmission by limiting contact between people.
","Question: Is there evidence to suggest that masks reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19?
Answer: The claim by Kimberly Klacik that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of face masks or lockdowns in reducing COVID-19 spread is inaccurate.

Question: What are the two papers that say lockdown was effective?
Answer: Two new papers published in the journal Nature say that lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus were highly effective, prevented tens of millions of infections and saved millions of lives.

Question: What is the evidence to support the claims that masks and lockdown slow COVID-19 spread?
Answer: Social media users have been sharing posts online that claim there is no evidence that face masks or lockdowns slow the spread of COVID-19.

21,21,763,Inaccurate early vote count in one Michigan county was a failure of the software used.,refuted,"Question: Was an inaccurate vote count in Michigan's Antrim County, during the 2020 elections, due to a software error?
Answer: No An inaccurate vote count in Michigan’s Antrim County was never an official result and was due to a human error in not updating to the latest version, not a failure in Dominion Voting Systems software itself.. 

Question: Did Dominion Voting Systems software fail in Antrim county?
Answer: Baseless claims about Dominion Voting Systems and the November 2020 election have been fully debunked by election authorities, subject matter experts, and third-party fact-checkers.

Question: What was the human error that caused Antrim County's temporarily inaccurate vote count?
Answer: J. Alex Halderman, the U-M professor and voting systems expert, said he has looked into the incident and determined that the problem arose because Antrim officials made a mistake before the election when they loaded a new version of the ""election definition"" — the data that is similar to a spreadsheet describing the races and candidates on the ballot.

According to the state, the new ""election definition"" was loaded in October after county officials learned of two local races in which ballot information had to be updated.

County officials correctly loaded the new version onto the scanners for the affected precincts, but left the old version on scanners for precincts where the ballot was not affected by the late change, Halderman said.

So although the scanners in the tabulators counted all the votes in each precinct correctly, the different versions of the ballot resulted in problems and erroneous vote totals when the precinct results were combined in the election management system, a separate software package used to manage and consolidate results before they are reported to the state, he said.

""Since the scanners ... used slightly different election definitions, some of the positions didn't line up properly,"" Halderman said. ""As a result, when the results were read by the election management system, some of them were initially assigned to the wrong candidates.""
","Question: What was the error in Michigan's vote counting?
Answer: Inaccurate early vote count in one Michigan county was a human error, not a failure of the software

Question: How did Michigan’s secretary of state identify and fix the error in its election results?

has a mortality per case ratio of somewhere between 0.5 and 3.4%,2
 although these figures are likely
to be revised once more is known about background infection rates. An informed estimate by the
English Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Professor Chris Whitty suggests a probable mortality rate in the
region of 1% or less.

Question: What are the basis for defining death as caused by COVID-19?
Answer: A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death

Question: how straightforward is it to calculate the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the time of the claim?
Answer: Case fatality ratio (CFR) is the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease and is therefore a measure of severity among detected cases. 
In the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen broad variations in naïve estimations of CFR that may be misleading. Countries are difficult to compare for a number of reasons. They may be more or less likely to detect and report all COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, they may be using different case definitions and testing strategies or counting cases differently (for example, with mild cases not being tested or counted). Variations in CFR also may be explained in part by the way time lags are handled. Differing quality of care or interventions being introduced at different stages of the illness also may play a role. Finally, the profile of patients (for example their age, sex, ethnicity and underlying comorbidities) may vary between countries.
","Question: Why is COVID-19 Survival rate not 99%?
Answer: Why the COVID-19 survival rate is not over 99%

Question: What is the 99.99% survival ratio used in the modelling of COVID-19 cases?
Answer: The post’s claim of a “99.996% survival rate” appears to be based on a misinterpretation of a figure used for modelling public health responses.

Question: What is a good estimate for survival rates for COVID-19?
Answer: The survival rate varies by country but this estimate is too high for the UK. Estimates of the survival rate range from around 99% to 99.5%.

The new data highlights the danger of the presence of guns during politically charged protests, and raises concerns about continued violence during and after election day, when many Americans anticipate delays, confusion and protests before the winner of the presidential race is confirmed.
Violence at US protests

The new data on fatalities and violence at American protests comes from a database created by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED), a non-profit, working in collaboration with a group of researchers at Princeton.

ACLED, a widely cited source for data on civilian casualties in Yemen, has been a non-partisan monitor of protests and violence in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and Latin America, and launched its US Crisis Monitor in July, citing concerns over hate crimes and rising political violence.

ACLED found that the overwhelming majority of the more than 9.000 Black Lives Matter demonstrations that took place across the US after the killing of George Floyd have been peaceful. News reports at the height of demonstrations over Floyd’s killing cited dozens of deaths in connection with protests, but many of those turned out to be examples of deadly crimes carried out in the vicinity of protests, rather than directly related to the demonstrations themselves, the researchers concluded. ACLED’s dataset only focuses on political violence.

Answer: MEMO
GEORGIA ELECTION INTEGRITY ACT OF 2021 1
Georgia Election Integrity Act of 2021
On March 25, 2021, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signed into law the ""Election Integrity Act of
2021"" (formerly SB 202), an election bill that aims to restore trust and integrity in the state’s election
process. The Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA) supports the reforms implemented
in this bill and highlights the need for such reforms to close loopholes that threaten the democratic
process.
The Election Integrity Act of 2021 is a commonsense approach that makes it easy to vote and
hard to cheat. It provides fair and consistent rules for Georgia elections statewide, a duty of the
Georgia legislature. These new rules include reasonable reforms such as replacing signature
match with a government-issued photo identification requirement (Georgia issues free voter
identification cards), better security of ballot drop boxes, and broader access to voting for all
Georgians. Georgia’s new law contains rational and sound policy provisions to ensure fair and
free elections, and its measures actually increase access to voting. 1
Below are some of the key provisions of the Election Integrity Act of 2021. As a result of this law,
Georgians can expect the efficiency of their elections to continue to improve and voter
participation to continue to rise.
Prohibiting Gifts and Restricting Private Money
• Prohibits local officials from taking or accepting non-government funds, grants, or gifts.
(GA SB 202, § 9, p. 18, ln. 430-432 (election superintendents); GA SB 202, § 14, p. 23, ln. 563-565 (board of
registrars).)
• Requires the State Election Board to propose a process to distribute private donations for
election administration equitably throughout the state. (GA SB 202, § 9, p. 18, ln. 433-435)
• Prohibits giving cash or gifts (including food or drinks) to voters. (GA SB 202, § 33, p. 73, ln. 1872-
1875.) Note that poll officers may provide self-service water available from an unattended
","Question: What does Georgia law make illegal?
Answer: “Georgia law doesn’t make it a crime to bring water (yourself), but does make it a crime to bring water to someone standing in line.”

Question: Is it illegal to offer food or drink to a voter in Georgia?
Answer: The bulletin also reminds elections officials that offering food, drinks, or other items of value to voters waiting in line or those who have already voted is forbidden under Georgia law (OCGA § 21-2-570).

Question: Is there a law in Georgia that says you cannot give water or food to voters while they are in a line to vote?
Answer: One of the most contentious provisions is Georgia's ban on giving voters food or water while they're in line at the polls.

Answer: . The World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health Canada agree that masks are generally safe to use and help to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has infected more than 100 million people, killing nearly 2.4 million globally.

https://www.boomlive.in/world/fake-news-covid-19-face-masks-lung-cancer-12046

Question: Does wearing face masks cause cancer?
Answer: Wearing a face mask does not put you at a higher risk of cancer. There is no current evidence linking the use of face masks to cancer, and science shows that any risks associated with wearing masks are low overall, while the benefits are high. 

Because of how tiny oxygen and carbon dioxide molecules are, face masks neither decrease the amount of oxygen that enters a mask nor increase the amount of carbon dioxide that stays in a mask. As a result, face masks do not disrupt the body’s pH levels, affect the bloodstream, or alter one’s body in any way that would put someone at higher risk of cancer.

Question: Does wearing a face mask cause low oxygen levels?
Answer: Absolutely not. We wear masks all day long in the hospital. The masks are designed to be breathed through and there is no evidence that low oxygen levels occur.
","Question: What is the purpose of wearing masks in order to slow down the spreading of COVID 19?
Answer: But, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wearing a mask can help slow the spread of the coronavirus, especially from those who may have COVID-19 and not realize it.
