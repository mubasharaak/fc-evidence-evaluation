This is another public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to social or physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and other preventive actions.\n\nThe CDC Trusted Source recommends healthcare workers wear face masks when working with patients who have the flu.\n\nThe CDC also recommendsTrusted Source patients who show signs of respiratory infections be given masks while they\u2019re in healthcare settings until they can be isolated.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick and need to be around others, properly wearing a mask can protect those around you from contracting the virus and developing an illness.Wearing a mask keeps the coronavirus from spreading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says masks are one of the most powerful tools available we have.\n\nMasks don\u2019t just prevent the spread of coronavirus. They can also prevent the spread of the flu, the common cold, and other respiratory diseases.\n\nQuestion: What have studies found about the effectiveness of mask use in preventing the spread of COVID-19?\nAnswer: A study on \"Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection, and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China,\" found that face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79).In a study called \"The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,\" the findings indicated that \"our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% CI: 1.9\u20132.6) to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5\u20134.3)\u00a0 after imposing lockdown.\" A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, P < 0.05 vs after lockdown: r = 0.91, P = NS).\n\nConclusions: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases were observed, which are most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high-risk areas seems to have the potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.In a study called \"Is the lockdown important to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic? Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective,\" the lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and this study demonstrated that this preventive restriction can significantly reduce virus spread. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown.\n\nQuestion: Do lockdowns slow down the spread of COVID-19?\nAnswer: Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as \u2018lockdowns\u2019, can slow COVID\u201119 transmission by limiting contact between people.\n", "response": {"explanation": "The evidence provided includes multiple sources and studies that indicate both masks and lockdowns are effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19.

There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death\n\nQuestion: how straightforward is it to calculate the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the time of the claim?\nAnswer: Case fatality ratio (CFR) is the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease and is therefore a measure of severity among detected cases. \nIn the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen broad variations in na\u00efve estimations of CFR that may be misleading. Countries are difficult to compare for a number of reasons. They may be more or less likely to detect and report all COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, they may be using different case definitions and testing strategies or counting cases differently (for example, with mild cases not being tested or counted). Variations in CFR also may be explained in part by the way time lags are handled. Differing quality of care or interventions being introduced at different stages of the illness also may play a role.

{"claim": "After one year, there is still no evidence that masks or lockdowns slow the spread of COVID-19.", "evidence": "Question: Does mask wearing slow down the spread of COVID-19?\nAnswer: In the case of the novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the CDC Trusted Source notes that simple face coverings or masks can reduce its spread.\n\nIt recommends that people wear a face covering or mask to cover their nose and mouth when in the community. This is another public health measure people should take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in addition to social or physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and other preventive actions.\n\nThe CDC Trusted Source recommends healthcare workers wear face masks when working with patients who have the flu.\n\nThe CDC also recommendsTrusted Source patients who show signs of respiratory infections be given masks while they\u2019re in healthcare settings until they can be isolated.\n\nIf you\u2019re sick and need to be around others, properly wearing a mask can protect those around you from contracting the virus and developing an illness.Wearing a mask keeps the coronavirus from spreading. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says masks are one of the most powerful tools available we have.\n\nMasks don\u2019t just prevent the spread of coronavirus. They can also prevent the spread of the flu, the common cold, and other respiratory diseases.\n\nQuestion: What have studies found about the effectiveness of mask use in preventing the spread of COVID-19?\nAnswer: A study on \"Reduction of secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in households by face mask use, disinfection, and social distancing: a cohort study in Beijing, China,\" found that face mask use by the primary case and family contacts before the primary case developed symptoms was 79% effective in reducing transmission (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.79).In a study called \"The positive impact of lockdown in Wuhan on containing the COVID-19 outbreak in China,\" the findings indicated that \"our findings indicate a significant increase in doubling time from 2 days (95% CI: 1.9\u20132.6) to 4 days (95% CI: 3.5\u20134.3)\u00a0 after imposing lockdown.\" A further increase is detected after changing diagnostic and testing methodology to 19.3 (95% CI: 15.1-26.3), respectively. Moreover, the correlation between domestic air traffic and COVID-19 spread became weaker following lockdown (before lockdown: r = 0.98, P < 0.05 vs after lockdown: r = 0.91, P = NS).\n\nConclusions: A significantly decreased growth rate and increased doubling time of cases were observed, which are most likely due to Chinese lockdown measures. A more stringent confinement of people in high-risk areas seems to have the potential to slow down the spread of COVID-19.In a study called \"Is the lockdown important to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic? Effects on psychology, environment and economy-perspective,\" the lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and this study demonstrated that this preventive restriction can significantly reduce virus spread. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown.\n\nQuestion: Do lockdowns slow down the spread of COVID-19?\nAnswer: Large scale physical distancing measures and movement restrictions, often referred to as \u2018lockdowns\u2019, can slow COVID\u201119 transmission by limiting contact between people.\n", "response": {"explanation": "The evidence provided includes multiple sources and studies that indicate both masks and lockdowns are effective in slowing the spread of COVID-19.

An informed estimate by the\nEnglish Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Professor Chris Whitty suggests a probable mortality rate in the\nregion of 1% or less.\n\nQuestion: What are the basis for defining death as caused by COVID-19?\nAnswer: A COVID-19 death is defined for surveillance purposes as a death resulting from a clinically compatible illness in a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to COVID-19 disease (e.g. trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery between the illness and death\n\nQuestion: how straightforward is it to calculate the number of deaths from COVID-19 at the time of the claim?\nAnswer: Case fatality ratio (CFR) is the proportion of individuals diagnosed with a disease who die from that disease and is therefore a measure of severity among detected cases. \nIn the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen broad variations in na\u00efve estimations of CFR that may be misleading. Countries are difficult to compare for a number of reasons. They may be more or less likely to detect and report all COVID-19 deaths. Furthermore, they may be using different case definitions and testing strategies or counting cases differently (for example, with mild cases not being tested or counted). Variations in CFR also may be explained in part by the way time lags are handled. Differing quality of care or interventions being introduced at different stages of the illness also may play a role. Finally, the profile of patients (for example their age, sex, ethnicity and underlying comorbidities) may vary between countries.\n", "response": {"explanation": "The evidence provides information on the mortality rate of COVID-19, which is estimated to be between 0.5% and 3.4%, with a probable mortality rate in the region of 1% or less according to the English Chief Medical Officer.
